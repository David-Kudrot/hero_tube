            <h4>var</h4>
            <h6>Function Scope :</h6>
            <p>
              The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that
              is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
            </p>
            <h6>Hoisting of var :</h6>
            <p>
              Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their
              scope before code execution.
            </p>
            <h4>Let</h4>
            <h6>Block Scope:</h6>
            Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are visible within the block they
            are declared in (like loops or if statements).
            <h6>Hoisting of let</h6>
            Just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the
            let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a
            Reference Error.
            <h4>Const :</h4>
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with
            let declarations.
            <strong>const declarations are block scoped</strong>
            Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
            <h6>Hoisting of const:</h6>
            Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.

            <h4>null</h4>
            It is explicitly used to represent the absence of a value or an empty value.
            It is a primitive value that indicates a deliberate nonexistence or absence of any object value.
            It can be assigned to a variable to signify that the variable intentionally holds no value or has been
            explicitly set to nothing.
            <h4>undefined</h4>
            It represents the absence of a value in a variable that has not been assigned a value or has not been
            initialized.
            When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it automatically gets assigned undefined by
            JavaScript.
            It is a primitive value that indicates the variable or object property has not been assigned any value.

            <h4>Rest API</h4>
            REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a style of designing web services that allows different systems to communicate over the internet.
            REST APIs provide a structured way for systems to interact, allowing resources to be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and URIs. They have become a popular choice for building web services due to their simplicity, flexibility, and scalability.
